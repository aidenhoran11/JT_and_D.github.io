                    Have you ever met someone before that shouldn't exist. Well, unfortunately now you have. This is 
                    Emilios Tsiros. He is the original sentence generator of our group and where most of our scene ideas
                    come from. He is an unstoppable force and an immovable object, unless the thing trying to move him
                    is a dominant women with colored hair. He will actively zone out of conversations as you are talking
                    to him unless it is about his 1 true love, his latest mustang. As the most dangerous of the group,
                    be cautious if you ever encounter emilios in real life. Your best method of escape will be to shake
                    a shiny object in front of his face. If your a woman you can just speak to him with an authority
                    and he will follow your commands like a dog.

                    Unarguably the least popular of the group by fans and members alike Aiden Horan is seen header
                    sporting what he believes to be a flattering and comedic piece. Aiden is know for his 'comedic'
                    love for cross-dressing and will find any excuse for it despite the protests of his close friends
                    and family. Despite all of this he still thinks it to be believable when he tell people that he
                    isn't gay. The only question left for us to ask is when will he realize he is inside a transparent
                    closet. If you encounter an Aiden in the wild, your best method of escape will be to complement
                    him. Although a difficult task to complete it will completely fluster Aiden as he does not get 
                    complimented often.

                    You might not be able to tell from the image but Kayley Horan is actually this groups only
                    female. This token of diversity is shockingly the biggest misogynist of the group. Makes you
                    wonder why she was chosen out of all the female talent out there... ah it's probably just a
                    coincidence. Kayley like her brother, loves to cross-dress and thinks its the pinnacle of
                    comedy as well. It's obvious there is something wrong with this family. Kayley specializes
                    in creating all of JT&D posters, designing this site, and convincing people she is sane.
                    If you run into her in real life your best method of escape is to wait for her to zone
                    out in the middle of one of her own sentences.

                    Sam

                <div>
                    Last and least we have the saddest member of the group Sam Barringer. This chunky ball of 
                    disappointment is deathly allergic to most things fun. As the writer and arguably 
                    the most competent of this group of fuck-ups he always seems to find a way to come 
                    out on the bottom. Is that a hint about his sexual preference? He would say no, but 
                    he isn't here right now so I say it is. Seen here being the theater kid he is Sam has since
                    rejected his past life of acting in search of higher paying jobs like philosophy. Ya that hasn't
                    really worked out for him. If you encounter a wild Sam your best method of escape is to simply
                    walk away, he is quite slow and will quickly become out of breath.
